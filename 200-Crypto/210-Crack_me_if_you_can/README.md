## Challenge Description:

Someone encrypted the flag with a mysterious encryption schemeâ€¦ lucky for us he also sent the encryption algorithm with the ciphertext

## Challenge Points:

200pt

## Challenge Solution:

For this Challenge the encryption algorithm is included so we have two options:

1- Reverse the algorithm.
2- Attack thr algorithm.

for me i go with attacking using know plaintext attack.

the algorithm is monoalphabetic so it is easy map every chr. and it has a rotate function.

See 'dec_sol.py'.
