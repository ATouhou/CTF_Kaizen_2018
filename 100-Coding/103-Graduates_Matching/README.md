## Challenge Description:

Olympic City is trying to come up with an algorithm to optimize employment of fresh graduates. This year, the program will be applied to 100 graduates and 100 companies. To this end, the Ministry of Labor came up with the following rules:
1.	Each graduate applies to up to 10 companies (this means they can apply to less than 10), and lists them from their most favorite to their least favorite. We already have this list in the file called graduates.txt
2.	Each company then looks at the graduates who applied to it, and lists them from their most favorite to their least favorite. We already have this list in the file called companies.txt
3.	The assumption is that each company can accept only one candidate. The algorithm then tries to find the best company match for each graduate
Help Olympic City come up with this algorithm. Your result should be 100 pairings that look like this: (Graduate-0,Company-A),(Graduate-1,Company-B),(Graduate-3,Company-C)...(Graduate-99,Company-N) where A, B, C, â€¦, N are numbers. Make sure there are no spaces anywhere. The flag is the MD5 hash of this result, so it should look like this: f1ac5ca3754c5238f3976effd1389d2c
